# **Powerplant API**
## Presentation
This API is made in the framework of a coding challenge about powerplants. 
It calculates how much power different powerplants need to produce for a specific load. It also takes into account the cost of underlying energy sources and the price of CO2 emission allowances.

## Guidance

### Step 1:
Download all folders and files by pressing the green "Code" button and "Download ZIP" (or Open with GitHub Desktop) :

## Step 2
Starting this step, Python needs to be installed on the computer.
Open a code editor (*e.g.*, Visual Studio Code) and add:
* "templates" folder
* API_Engie.py file

## Step 3
To ensure that the code is working well, all the library found in the file "requirements.txt" needs to be installed. (It might require to restart the code editor).

## Step 4
The code in the file "API_Engie.py" can be run. A link to the API should appear in the terminal (cf yellow link bellow):

Click on the link to open the webpage.
In order access the calculation API, "/productionplan" needs to be added at the end of the link.

## Step 5
On the calculation page, a file needs to be uploaded. This file must be a ".JSON" with the same structure of the "exemple.payload.json" file.
When the file is uploaded, press "submit" and results will appear in a json format.
