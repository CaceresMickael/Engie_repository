# **Powerplant API**
## Presentation
This API is made in the framework of a coding challenge about powerplants. 
It calculate how much power different powerplants need to produce for a specific load and take into account the cost  of the underlying energy sources and the price of CO2 emission allowances.

## Guidance

### Step 1:
Download all folders and files by pressing the green "Code button" and "Download ZIP" (or Open with GitHub Desktop) :

## Step 2
Starting this step Python need to be install in the computer.
Open a code editor (*e.g*: Visual Studio Code) and add:
* "templates" folder
* API_Engie.py file

## Step 3
To be sure that the code is working well, all the library found in the file "requirements.txt" need to be install. (It would maybe require to restart the code editor).

## Step 4
The code in the file "API_Engie.py" can be run. A link to the API should appear in the terminal (cf yellow link bellow):

Click to this link to open a webpage. 
To access to the calculation API, /productionplan need to be added at the end of the link.

## Step 5
Once the the calculation part, a file need to be upload. This file need imperatively to be a .json and have the same structure as in the "exemple.payload.json" file.
When the file is uploaded, press submit and the result will appear in a json format.
